= Notes for Contributing Developers

Before committing code, please remember to:

* Remove necessary Usings at the top.
* Reformat the code (see below).
* Delete unused code (do not just comment it out).
* Try to ensure that commits are atomic (that is, if you are committing two changes that have nothing to do with each other, then commit them separately).
* Use meaningful commit comments.

== Formatting Standards

Be sure to take advantage of the automatic formatting in Visual Studio (Ctrl-K/Ctrl-F).

IMPORTANT: The GruntWurk standard is to use Visual Studio's default settings EXCEPT that the default settings insert way too many extra line breaks. So, before reformatting any code, pull down the Tools menu, select Options... > Text Editor > C# > Formatting > New Lines, and uncheck every option under "New line options for braces" and "New line options for keywords".

Thanks.
